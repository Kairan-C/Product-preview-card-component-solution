## My process

Started working on the desktop version everything was simple until the mobile version, I haven't used @media queries that much but it was fun to learn

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Learned how to use @media queries and the use of variables to change all the layout of the elements, and write more semantic html.

### Continued development

Still need to work on using relative values and accessibility
